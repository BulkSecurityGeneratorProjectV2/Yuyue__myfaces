<p>Jasper, the JSP parser from the Apache Tomcat project, is included here.</p>
The original package name is org.apache.jasper and was refactored to net.sourceforge.myfaces.renderkit.html.jspinfo.jasper.
The Tomcat version of this Jasper implementation was 4.0.4.

Modifications after refactoring:
- Added following DTDs to the resources dir and modified the paths in
  Constants.java and ParserXJspSaxHandler so that we do not depend on
  the DTDs in servlet.jar and are compatible to BEA Weblogic:
        web-jsptaglibrary_1_1.dtd
        web-jsptaglibrary_1_2.dtd
        web-app_2_2.dtd
        web-app_2_3.dtd

TODO: Eliminate unused files and classes
