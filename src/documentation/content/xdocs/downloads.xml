    <p>Currently, Apache MyFaces has no JSR-127 TCK certified releases.</p>

<section>
    <title>Milestone Downloads</title>
    <p>The following non-certified milestone releases are available.
        We feel confident that MyFaces has reached a production stable state.
        But keep in mind that these milestone releases are 'technology demonstrations'
        and not offered as JSF 1.1-compatible implementation.</p>
