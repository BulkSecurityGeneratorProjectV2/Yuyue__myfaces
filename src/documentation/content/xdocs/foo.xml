        <title>February 23, 2005 - MyFaces is Now a Top Level Apache Project</title>
        <note label="Email to myfaces-dev from ASF Board">
            Hi All,<br/>
            <br/>
            Congratulations to all for officially making MyFaces into a top level Apache
            project!
            <br/><br/>
            For the last couple of years, I believe the project has come a long way from
            its small beginnings. All of this is thanks to the contribution of every one
            of you, regardless of how large or small. Open source development, coupled
            with strong leadership (Manfred and others), is always a winning combination!
            <br/><br/>
            Once again, Congratulations.
            <br/><br/>
            Anton
