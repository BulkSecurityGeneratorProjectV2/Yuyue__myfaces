    <p>
        MyFaces uses JIRA for reporting bugs, and for suggesting/requesting enhancements.  These issues 
        are automatically forwarded to the MyFaces development team.  Please provide as much information 
        as possible and include steps to reproduce the bug.  If you have a solution to the bug please include a patch file.  
        <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/howto/howto-patch.html">Here</link>  is a good link explaining some of the 
        details associated with patch files.
