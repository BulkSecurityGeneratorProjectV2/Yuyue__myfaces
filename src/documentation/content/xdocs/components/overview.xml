        <title>Custom Components</title>
        <p>
            MyFaces provides a series of JSF components that go beyond the JSF specification.  These components are 100% compatible
            with the Sun JSF 1.1 Reference Implementation (RI) or any other JSF 1.1 compatible implementation.  Of course the custom
            components can also be used with the Apache MyFaces JSF implementation.
        </p>

        <title>Extended Components and Other "Goodies"</title>
        <p>
            In addition to custom components not found in the JSF specification, the MyFaces components bundle also includes an
            "extended" version of some of the default components.  These are basically components that exist in either the core or
            html tag libraries but additional functionality has been addded that goes beyond the specification.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example: &lt;x:inputText> - This is similar to the &lt;h:inputText> component but it provides additional attributes
                such as <code>forceId</code>.  When this attribute is <code>true</code> the HTML generated will used the id
                specified by the <code>id</code> attribute instead of the one normally generated by following the JSF specification.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Converters - MyFaces components project contains several custom objects that do not implement <code>UIComponent</code>.
                Some of these include objects that implement the <code>Converter</code> interface.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Tiles Support - MyFaces provides a custom solution to allow use to use Tiles together with JSF.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <warning label="Warning">
            The MyFaces version of Tiles Support requires the MyFaces JSF implementation.  It will not work with the Sun RI or
            any other JSF implementation. This is the only MyFaces "goody" that does not work with all implementations.  It
            should be emphasized that Tiles can theoretically work with any JSF implementation (even though it is tricky due to
            the nature of the JSF specification.)
        </warning>

    <section>
        <title>Requirements and Setup</title>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Put the <code>myfaces-extensions.jar</code> in your <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory (or in the classpath of your
                application server.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <note label="Note">
            If you are using the MyFaces implementation you can choose to use the <code>myfaces.jar</code> instead.  It is basically
            a single jar file containing the JSF 1.1 API, JSF 1.1 Implementation and the MyFaces custom components.
        </note>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Add the following to your JSP page in order to use one of the MyFaces custom components: <br/><br/>
                <code>&lt;%@ taglib uri="http://myfaces.apache.org/extensions" prefix="x"%></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                That's it! You're good to go.  Please see additional documentation for specific issues regarding the MyFaces API and
                implementation packages.
            </li>
        </ul>
