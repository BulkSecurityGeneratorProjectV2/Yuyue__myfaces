<h1>MyFaces Features
</h1><h3>What is it, that makes MyFaces different?
</h3>
<br/><div class="titlebar">Saving model state information in the client response</div>Traditional JSP Applications save their state information within HttpSession objects. This is an easy to use but poor approach:

<br/><ul><li> HttpSession objects must have an expiration date (timeout) that prevents the server from running out of memory over the time. The always boring question for web admins: How long should I set the session timout?
</li><li> Server restarting is a thrilling task: Will all objects in active sessions be serialized and restored successfully? If implementation classes have changed in the meantime, this task is likely to fail.
</li><li> Running multiple redundant servers is a challenge. You must use cluster environments which are expensive and difficult to handle.
</li></ul>
<br/>MyFaces has a different approach. It makes it possible to write sophisticated applications without any use of the HttpSession. All state information of the current jsf view and (optionally) the model beans can be encoded to the client response either in the form of hidden form inputs or as query parameters in hyperlinks.
<br/>
<br/>MyFaces introduces a new Component &quot;UISaveState&quot; with the corresponding Tag &quot;&lt;x:save_state&gt;&quot;.
<br/>Example (see &quot;sample1.jsp&quot; of the &quot;examples&quot; web application):

<br/><font face="courier" size="2">&nbsp;&lt;x:save_state&nbsp;id=&quot;save1&quot;&nbsp;value=&quot;#{calcForm.number1}&quot;&nbsp;/&gt;
</font><br/><font face="courier" size="2">&nbsp;&lt;x:save_state&nbsp;id=&quot;save2&quot;&nbsp;value=&quot;#{calcForm.number2}&quot;&nbsp;/&gt;
</font><br/><font face="courier" size="2">&nbsp;&lt;x:save_state&nbsp;id=&quot;save3&quot;&nbsp;value=&quot;#{ucaseForm.text}&quot;&nbsp;/&gt;

</font><br/>The current values of the three properties number1, number2 and text are automatically saved within the client response and get restored at the next client request.
<br/>
<br/>You can also save the whole bean.
<br/>Example:
<br/><font face="courier" size="2">&nbsp;&lt;x:save_state&nbsp;id=&quot;saveCalcForm&quot;&nbsp;value=&quot;#{calcForm}&quot;&nbsp;/&gt;
</font><br/>The whole bean automatically is saved and restored by MyFaces.
<br/>To be able to save and restore the value of a bean property or the bean itself, it must implement the Serializable interface.
