Subject: Draft resolution to graduate MyFaces from the incubator to TLP

The Incubator PMC and MyFaces PPMC have voted to graduate MyFaces from
the incubator. It would be our preference for MyFaces to become a top
level project. We have drafted a resolution for the board's review and
approval. We would request that the board place this matter on its
agenda at your earliest convenience.
