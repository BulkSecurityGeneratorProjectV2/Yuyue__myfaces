Community
========
We have a strong community and the user list is frequently used: about
10 new threads a day, 3 replies at an average, almost no thread with
no reply at all.

Management
==========
As resolved by the board the MyFaces PMC consists of the following intial members:
 Manfred Geiler (manolito@apache.org)
 Thomas Spiegl (tomsp@apache.org)
 Martin Marinschek (mmarinschek@apache.org)
 Matthias Wessendorf (matzew@apache.org )
 Sylvain Vieujot (svieujot@apache.org )
 Grant Smith (grantsmith@apache.org )
 Bill Dudney (bdudney@apache.org )
 Anton Koinov (anton@apache.org )
 Travis Reeder (treeder@apache.org)
 Ted Husted (husted@apache.org)

Domain
======
I'm still owner of the myfaces.org domain and would like to point it
to myfaces.apache.org if there is nothing to be said against this. It
expires in february 2006 and we could discuss later if it makes sense
to renew.

Infrastructure
=========
On the technical layer we are not yet completely finished with moving
out of the Incubator. Main reason for this is our current discussion
about the future project structure, which is not yet finished. FYI,
MyFaces consists of some parts that need to be separated and
rearranged: the JSR-127 API, the base JSF implementation, common
classes, additional non-standard components and extensions, a sandbox
(not yet)...
Before there is no full agreement here, we do not want to bother
infrastructure with things like CVS/SVN, mailing lists, jira, and so
on.

Release
======
We are currently voting on rc3 of 1.0.9 beta. So in the next days we
will publish our first official Apache TLP release "MyFaces 1.0.9
beta".
