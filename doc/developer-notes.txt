MyFaces Developer Notes
=======================

This document deals with issues that are important for MyFaces developers
and custom component developers.

(also see FAQs.txt)

======================================================================
Component developer guidelines

* Properties and attributes
  MyFaces' MinimizingStateSaver is only able to save the state of a component,
  if all important (state relevant) values are stored as bean properties. So,
  every member field that should be saved between requests, must have a public
  getter and also a public setter method.
  Also have in mind, that StateSaver does not save renderer dependent attributes
  that have names starting with "net.sourceforge.myfaces.", "net.sf.myfaces."
  or "javax.". These are regarded temporary attributes and will not be saved and
  restored!

======================================================================
MyFaces developers guidelines

* Code style
  Basis for the code conventions of the MyFaces project are Suns Java Code
  Conventions at
  http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html

* Addition special comments (see 10.5.4 in CodeConv)
  TODO: something that is not yet ready
  HACK: something that is bogus but (meanwhile) necessary to make it work
  XXX:  something that is bogus but works
  FIXME: something that is bogus and broken

* CVS
  - Every developer may upload files, if (s)he is confident, that this
    file is usable for others.
  - Uploaded java files must be compilable, of course.
  - Changes to java files must leave the whole project in a state where it
    is still compilable.
  - Foreign files should only be committed (changed) after consulting and/or
    informing the original author. The same applies for deleting, of course.
    Exception: Trivial changes such as spelling mistakes in comments, etc.

* Copyright
  Every file should start with the following copyright notice:
