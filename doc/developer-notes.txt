MyFaces Developer Notes
=======================

This document deals with issues that are important for MyFaces developers
and custom component developers.

(also see FAQs.txt)

======================================================================
Component developer guidelines

* Attributes instead of class members
TODO: still true?
  MyFaces' StateSaver is only able to save the state of a component, if all
  important (state relevant) values are stored as component attributes.
  i.e. Every value that should be saved between requests, must appear in the
  getAttributeNames() iterator.
  So, as a rule of thumb: Never store information that is important to the
  state of a component in a class member, but rather with a call to setAttribute().

  Have in mind, that all attribute names starting with "net.sourceforge.myfaces."
  or "javax." are regarded temporary attributes and will not be saved!

MyFaces developers guidelines

* Code style
  Basis for the code conventions of the MyFaces project are Suns Java Code
  Conventions at
  http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html

* Addition special comments (see 10.5.4 in CodeConv)
  TODO: something that is not yet ready
  HACK: something that is bogus but (meanwhile) necessary to make it work
  XXX:  something that is bogus but works
  FIXME: something that is bogus and broken

* CVS
  - Every developer may upload files, if (s)he is confident, that this
    file is usable for others.
  - Uploaded java files must be compilable, of course.
  - Changes to java files must leave the whole project in a state where it
    is still compilable.
  - Foreign files should only be committed (changed) after consulting and/or
    informing the original author. The same applies for deleting, of course.
    Exception: Trivial changes such as spelling mistakes in comments, etc.

* Copyright
  Every file should start with the following copyright notice:

  Every class and interface should have a javadoc similar to
