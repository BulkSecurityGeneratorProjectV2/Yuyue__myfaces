MyFaces Developer Notes
=======================

This document deals with issues that are important for MyFaces developers
and custom component developers.

* FacesBodyTag:
  The FacesBodyTag in the current jsf-api EA release is not implemented fully
  (e.g. doStartTag() does nothing). This issue has been disussed in Sun's JSF Forum.
  To bypass that hitch, MyFaces has a patch.
  Two ways to apply this patch:
  1. Make sure that this class comes before the original api class in the classpath.
     Tomcat puts the WEB-INF/classes dir before the lib dir, so normally this should
     work.
  or
  2. You can also patch the jsf-api.jar directly. Just remove the original class
     from the jar file and add this version. You can use the jar tool in the
     Java JDK or WinZip or any other zip tool.
  Sorry for the inconvenience, but because of current JSF license we are not allowed
  to publish the jsf-api.jar together with MyFaces.
