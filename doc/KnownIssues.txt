MyFaces Known Issues
====================

* Right after starting a myfaces application the following message may be logged:
    WARNING: Error in faces-config.xml - inconsistency with TLD: Attribute
    'selectedIndex' of renderer 'TabbedPane' has different class in Taglib
    descriptor.
  You can safely ignore this message.

* id attributes in Tomcat 5:
  Tomcat 5 tries to translate id attributes of tags to java variables without
  revision of the name. So, you must not use hyphens (or other special
  characters) in id attributes.

TODO... (Many others!)
