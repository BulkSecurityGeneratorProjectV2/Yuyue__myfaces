MyFaces Known Issues
====================

* Sun's current implementation of the FacesTag has a bug, that makes problems
  when you use IterationTag support:
  For each tag they count the number of children tags in a member "numChildren".
  Well, they do not reset this member to 0 in doAfterBody(). So, on the
  next iteration this counter continues counting and components that do
  not have an id are created again during findComponent().
  Solution:
  - Either give every tag within an IterationTag an id,
  - or subclass all your common tags from MyFacesTag, that fixes this behaviour.
