MyFaces Known Issues
====================

* Problems with Tomcat 4.1.x
  Symptoms: 1. Every other request throws a ServletException. Doing a browser
               refresh renders the page.
            2. ResourceBundle handling is completly broken. Navigation item
               labels are totally messed.
  Reason: Not known yet. Perhaps Tomcat's ClassLoader makes problems?

* Sun's current implementation of the FacesTag has a bug, that makes problems
  when you use IterationTag support:
  For each tag they count the number of children tags in a member "numChildren".
  Well, they do not reset this member to 0 in doAfterBody(). So, on the
  next iteration this counter continues counting and components that do
  not have an id are created again during findComponent().
  Solution:
  - Either give every tag within an IterationTag an id,
  - or subclass all your common tags from MyFacesTag, that fixes this behaviour.

* Dynamic addition of components as stated in JSF.2.4.2.4 is not (yet) supported
  when using the "saveStateInClient" feature.

* Facet support is not yet implemented.

TODO... (Many others!)
