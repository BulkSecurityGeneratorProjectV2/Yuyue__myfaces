MyFaces Known Issues
====================

* Accessing a run-time attribute in a child component during encodeBegin may return an unpredictable result.
  Reason: Run-time values of component attributes are set by the doStart method of the
  corresponding Tag. If a component accesses a "non-static" attribute in a child component,
  this value might not yet be set to the right value.
