MyFaces Known Issues
====================

* Right after starting a myfaces application the following message may be logged:
    WARNING: Error in faces-config.xml - inconsistency with TLD: Attribute
    'selectedIndex' of renderer 'TabbedPane' has different class in Taglib
    descriptor.
  You can safely ignore this message.

* id attributes in Tomcat 5:
  Tomcat 5 tries to translate id attributes of tags to java variables without
  revision of the name. So, you must not use hyphens (or other special
  characters) in id attributes.
  
* to make the examples webapp war file for a version of tomcat less than 5.5,
  you need to uncomment the lines including the connons-el.jar and jsp-2.0.jar.
  Those 2 commented lines can be found around line 100 in the
  /build/examples-webapp/build.xml file.

TODO... (Many others!)
