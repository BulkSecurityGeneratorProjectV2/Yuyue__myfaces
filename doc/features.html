<h3>MyFaces Features</h3>

<h4>Saving the full tree and model state information in the client response</h4>

Traditional JSP Applications save their state information within HttpSession 
objects. This is an easy to use but poor approach:
<ul>
  <li>HttpSession objects must have an expiration date (timeout) that prevents the
    server from running out of memory over the time. The always boring question
    for web admins: How long should I set the session timout?
  <li>Server restarting is a thrilling task: Will all objects in active sessions
    be restored successfully? If implementation classes have changed this task
    is likely to fail.
  <li>Running multiple redundant servers is a challenge. You must use cluster
    environments which are expensive and difficult to handle.
</ul>

MyFaces has a different approach. It makes it possible to write sophisticated
applications without any use of the HttpSession. All state information of
the jsf tree and (optionally the model beans) is encoded to the client
response in the form of query parameters and hidden inputs in forms.


<h4>Support for saving model state</h4>

MyFaces introduces a new Component "UISaveState" with the corresponding Tag
"&lt;myfaces_ext:save_state&gt;".<br>
Example (see "sample1.jsp"):
    <code><pre>
    ...
    &lt;jsp:useBean id="calcForm"
                 class="net.sourceforge.myfaces.example.model.CalcForm"
                 scope="request" /&gt;
    ...
    &lt;f:use_faces&gt;
        ...
        &lt;x:save_state id="save1" modelReference="calcForm.number1" /&gt;
        &lt;x:save_state id="save2" modelReference="calcForm.number2" /&gt;
        &lt;x:save_state id="save3" modelReference="calcForm.result" /&gt;
        ...</pre></code>
The current values of the three properties number1, number2 and result get
automatically saved within the client response and restored from the
following client request.
    
<p>You can also save the whole bean.<br>
  Example:
    <pre><code>
    ...
    &lt;jsp:useBean id="calcForm"
                 class="net.sourceforge.myfaces.example.model.CalcForm"
                 scope="request" /&gt;
    ...
    &lt;f:use_faces>
        ...
        &lt;x:save_state id="save1" modelReference="calcForm" /&gt;
        ...</code></pre>
The whole bean automatically is saved (serialized) and restored by MyFaces.
    
<p>Keep in mind that to be able to save and restore the value of a bean property
or the bean itself, it must either be serializable or have a type that is
supported by a Converter (see package myfaces/converter/map).
    

<h4>State Saving Methods</h4>

MyFaces supports two ways of saving client state information:
<ul>
<li>"On the fly"<br>
    State info is encoded within HREFs and FORMs at once.<br>
    Drawback: The state of dynamic request time attributes that
              are calculated during JSP processing will not be
              saved correctly. Also the state of dynamically added
              or removed UIComponents will not be saved correctly.
<li>"Tokens"<br>
    State info is encoded within HREFs and FORMs as tokens (placeholders)
    that are replaced by the real state info after the JSP processing
    of MyFaces tags has finished.<br>
    Drawback: The usefaces tag must buffer all produced HTML code
              within it's body (see javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.BodyContent)
              and must do a search'n'replace before writing the
              content out to the response stream.
</ul>

MyFaces supports two methods of encoding the state information:
<ul>
<li>"Normal"<br>
    All state values are encoded as normal URL parameters.<br>
    i.e. Query parameters in HREFs and hidden inputs in FORMs
<li>"Zipped"<br>
    All state values are encoded to a String of key/value pairs
    that is zipped (GZIP) and encoded to allowed characters (Base64).
    This String is then written as one query parameter or hidden
    form input.
</ul>


<h4>UINavigation</h4>
A simple navigation component to build a vertical menu structure.<br>
(see web\example\inc\navigation.jsp for an example)
